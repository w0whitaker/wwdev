True story: at the beginning of the pandemic, I decided that I was going to focus on making art, and not on making a website for that art. That lasted maybe a month&#8212;first I tried a managed site, got frustrated that I couldn't style it the way I wanted to, then tried a premium WordPress theme. That was fine, but kind of slow. So I ended up making this, the first custom WordPress theme that I _finished_.

I've had many portfolio sites for my artwork over the years. The first (see below) was just HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript. Since then, I've made versions using Drupal and Ruby on Rails. I'm currently working on a version that would use the existing WordPress installation as a headless CMS.
