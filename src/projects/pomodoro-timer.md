This was a project inspired by a [tutorial](https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/) by [Ayooluwa Isaiah](https://freshman.tech/about/). I decided to try adapting it to use Nuxt, Vuex, and Tailwind. The biggest lesson fron this experience was that it's ok to start doing something even when you have no idea how to do it.
