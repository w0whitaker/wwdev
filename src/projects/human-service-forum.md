The [Human Service Forum](https://www.humanserviceforum.org 'The Human Service Forum') is a non-profit serving human service professionals in Massachusetts. Their WordPress site had recently undergone a redesign, but it was slow and cluttered with unused plugins and themes. I volunteered to help them figure out how to improve their site's performance. After some general housekeeping, it became apparent that the custom theme they were currently using was the source of many of the issues. I rebuilt the theme from scratch, keeping the original design, and was able to reduce the page load-time from around twelve seconds to around three. In addition, much of the site's content had been written into the theme itself, making changes to it difficult and cumbersome. Using custom blocks, fields, and post types, I made almost all of the site's content editable from the dashboard.

> William has been a wonderful asset to HSF... He has made a HUGE difference on the back end of our website. It is much more user friendly for the staff as well as for people coming to use our site. William is the kind of person who puts his all into the work that he does and we could not be more grateful.
