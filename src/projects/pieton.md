_Pi√©ton_ is the French word for pedestrian. (I don't really know why I chose it as the starting point for a CSS color scheme, but sometimes word get stuck in my head, and one thing leads to another.) I had a few goals with this project: I wanted to make an accessible color scheme, and put it in easy-to-use utility classes; I wanted to make use of CSS Grid; and I wanted to publish it as an NPM package.

I had a lot of fun doing this, although I've become less fond of the idea of utility classes as I've learned more about CSS, especially custom properties.
